# Stalker Challenge for Data Scientists
•Assume a “stalker” is someone who, in this dataset, visits some of the same locations as another person, after the other person goes to that location.  
•A “stalker score” for a pair of people, A & B, is the number of locations for which A has visited a location followed by B visiting that same location in the future.  
•Any given location should be counted once in the score, so a stalker score can never be higher than the number of unique locations that A and B have in common.  
1. Which friend pair has the highest “stalker score”?  
2. Which non-friend pair has the highest “stalker score”?  
Please give the winning user id pairs and “stalker score” for each question, and please explain your solution methods, including any source code if you wrote any.
